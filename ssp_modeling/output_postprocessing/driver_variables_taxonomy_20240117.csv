AFOLU,Land Use,lndu_reallocation_factor,Land Use Yield Reallocation Factor,"('', '')",cat_landuse,,,"The land use yield reallocation factor :math:`\eta \in [0, 1]` is used to represent land use responsiveness to changes in demands. 
 | 
 | If :math:`\eta = 1`, then **land use will be reallocated**, diverging from the specified transition matrix. If demands exceed carrying capacity to meet all livestock and crop demands, then the transitions into grassland and cropland are increased to meet demands. If the carrying capacity exceeds demand, then transitions to grassland and croplands are reduced (which also increases forested land). 
 | 
 | If :math:`\eta = 0`, then **land use will remain as specified**, and all remaining demands with be met with net imports. If the demand is less then carrying capacity, then there is an increase in net exports; if demand exceeds carrying capacity, there is an increase in net imports.
 | 
 | For :math:`\eta \in (0, 1)`, there is a mix of reallocation and net imports, which scales linearly between extremes.

SISEPUEDE works to prioritize constraints in the presence of conflicts, but infeasibilities may still occur.
 |

Energy,Industrial Energy,consumpinit_inen_energy_total_pj_agriculture_and_livestock,Initial Energy Consumption in Agriculture and Livestock,"('agriculture_and_livestock', 'agriculture_and_livestock')",cat_industry,,," | Total energy demand at time :math:`t = 0` for on-farm agricultural production, including off-road vehicles (such as tractors, combines, etc.) and other stationary agricultural equipment that may or not be electrical powered. Excludes residential demands and off-farm transportation (e.g., private vehicles and freight transport).
 | 
 | Initial energy consumption is combined with aggregated production in agriculture and livestock to estimate an average intensity at time 0.
 | 
 | Demands are passed to the industrial energy model, where emissions from different fuel uses are calculated. Efficiencies in technological use by fuel are assumed to respond to industrial averages.
 | 
 | Energy demands are assumed to grow proportionally with total tonnage of production. Process efficiencies--e.g., requiring less point-of-use energy to perform a task (different from efficiencies in fuel-use technologies)--can be implemented using the Demand Scalar."
